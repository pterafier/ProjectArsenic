Documentation for this project can be found here: https://pterafier.github.io/ArsenicDocs/

This project is a snapshot of some of the core systems created in Silvergrove Studio's DnD-style RPG, Project Arsenic. The documentation above helps describe the systems without having to dive into code, however if you're using this to learn or if you're a recruiter, I do recommend looking at the code. I'm very proud of it!
